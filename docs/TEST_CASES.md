# Eventky Test Cases

Comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios for validating Eventky functionality.

**Testing Approach:**
- Each test should be executed with a clean browser session
- Use at least 2-3 different user accounts (User A, User B, User C)
- Verify data persistence after browser refresh
- Check Nexus indexing delays (wait 2-3 seconds after writes)
- Validate both UI state and underlying data

## 13. Pubky Data Integrity Tests

**Purpose:** Verify that Eventky correctly uses Pubky primitives by validating homeserver storage, JSON structure, and Nexus indexing. These tests prove data flows through Pubky's decentralized architecture rather than custom databases.

**Tools:**
- **Pubky Observer:** Use [pubky.observer](https://pubky.observer) to inspect homeserver paths and view raw JSON
- **Nexus Swagger UI:** [https://nexus.eventky.app/swagger-ui/](https://nexus.eventky.app/swagger-ui/)
- **Direct HTTP:** `curl` commands to fetch homeserver data

**Test Format:** Each test includes verification steps for:
1. Homeserver storage (via Pubky Observer)
2. JSON structure (matches pubky-app-specs)
3. Nexus indexing (via API endpoints)

---

### 13.1 Calendar Data Integrity

#### Test: PUBKY-CAL-001 - Calendar Creation & Author Management

**Steps:**

1. **Create Calendar**
   - Login as User A
   - Create calendar: "Test Calendar"
   - Description: "Testing Pubky integration"
   - Color: `#FF5733`
   - Authors: User B (author)
   - Save and note Calendar ID (the part of the URL after the last slash)

2. **Verify Homeserver Storage**
   - Open [pubky.observer](https://pubky.observer)
   - Enter User A's public key
   - Navigate to: `/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{calendar_id}`
   - Verify JSON file exists

3. **Verify JSON Structure**
   - Check required fields present:
     - `name`: "Test Calendar"
     - `timezone`: (e.g., "America/New_York")
     - `created`: Unix microseconds timestamp
     - `x_pubky_authors`: Array containing User A and User B public keys
   - Check optional fields:
     - `description`: "Testing Pubky integration"
     - `color`: "#FF5733"
     - `sequence`: (should be 0. Each edit should increase this by 1)

4. **Verify Nexus Indexing**
   - Wait 2-3 seconds
   - Open Nexus Swagger UI
   - Execute: `GET /v0/calendar/{user_a_id}/{calendar_id}`
   - Verify response status: 200 OK
   - Check response contains correct calendar details

5. **Edit Calendar - Add User C as Author**
   - Login as User A
   - Edit calendar, add User C to authors
   - Save

6. **Re-verify Homeserver**
   - Refresh Pubky Observer
   - Check `/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{calendar_id}`
   - Verify `x_pubky_authors` now contains 2 public keys (B, C)
   - Verify `sequence` incremented by 1
   - Verify `last_modified` timestamp updated

7. **Re-verify Nexus**
   - Execute: `GET /v0/calendar/{user_a_id}/{calendar_id}`
   - Verify 2 authors in response

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Calendar JSON stored at correct homeserver path
- ✅ All fields match PubkyAppCalendar spec
- ✅ `x_pubky_authors` contains Pubky URIs (format: `pubky://{z32_public_key}`)
- ✅ Sequence increments on edit
- ✅ Nexus returns calendar with all authors

### 13.2 Event & Calendar Association

#### Test: PUBKY-EVT-001 - Event Creation with Calendar Reference

**Steps:**

1. **Setup**
   - Use calendar from PUBKY-CAL-001 (User A owner, User B author)
   - Note Calendar URI: `pubky://{user_a_pk}/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{cal_id}`

2. **Create Event as User B**
   - Login as User B (author, not owner)
   - Create event:
     - Summary: "Team Meeting"
     - Start: 2026-01-20T10:00:00
     - End: 2026-01-20T11:00:00
     - Select Calendar: "Test Calendar"
   - Save and note Event ID

3. **Verify Event on User B's Homeserver**
   - Open Pubky Observer
   - Enter User B's public key
   - Navigate to: `/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`
   - Verify JSON exists

4. **Verify Event JSON Structure**
   - Check required fields:
     - `uid`: UUID format
     - `dtstamp`: Creation timestamp
     - `dtstart`: "2026-01-20T10:00:00"
     - `dtend`: "2026-01-20T11:00:00"
     - `summary`: "Team Meeting"
   - **Check Pubky extension:**
     - `x_pubky_calendar_uris`: Array containing calendar URI from User A
   - Verify calendar URI format: `pubky://{user_a_pk}/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{cal_id}`

5. **Verify Calendar Still on User A's Homeserver**
   - Switch to User A's public key in Pubky Observer
   - Navigate to: `/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{cal_id}`
   - Confirm calendar unchanged (event data NOT embedded in calendar)

6. **Verify Nexus Event Indexing**
   - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_b_id}/{event_id}`
   - Verify response includes event details
   - Verify calendar reference present

7. **Verify Nexus Calendar Includes Event**
   - Execute: `GET /v0/calendar/{user_a_id}/{calendar_id}`
   - Check response includes `events` array
   - Verify array contains User B's event URI: `pubky://{user_b_pk}/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`

8. **Create Event Without Calendar**
   - Login as User B
   - Create event: "Personal Task"
   - Do NOT select any calendar
   - Save and note Event ID

9. **Verify Event JSON - No Calendar Reference**
   - Check User B's homeserver: `/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id2}`
   - Verify `x_pubky_calendar_uris` is either absent or empty array

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Event stored on User B's homeserver (not User A's)
- ✅ Event references calendar via URI in `x_pubky_calendar_uris`
- ✅ Calendar unchanged on User A's homeserver
- ✅ Nexus links event to calendar bidirectionally
- ✅ Event without calendar has no `x_pubky_calendar_uris` value

4. **Verify Attendee on User C's Homeserver**
   - Open Pubky Observer with User C's public key
   - Navigate to: `/pub/eventky.app/attendees/{attendee_id}`
   - Verify JSON file exists

5. **Verify Attendee JSON Structure**
   - Check required fields:
     - `partstat`: "ACCEPTED"
     - `created_at`: Unix microseconds
     - `x_pubky_event_uri`: `pubky://{user_a_pk}/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`
   - Check instance-specific field:
     - `recurrence_id`: "2026-01-27T09:00:00"

6. **Verify Event Unchanged on User A's Homeserver**
   - Check User A's homeserver: `/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`
   - Verify event JSON unchanged (RSVP data NOT embedded in event)

7. **Verify Nexus Event Attendees**
   - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_a_id}/{event_id}?limit_attendees=50`
   - Check response `attendees` array includes User C
   - Verify User C's RSVP status: "ACCEPTED"
   - Verify recurrence_id shown: "2026-01-27T09:00:00"

8. **RSVP to Different Instance**
   - Login as User C
   - Navigate to Week 3 instance (2026-02-03T09:00:00)
   - Click "Decline" RSVP

9. **Verify Second Attendee Object**
   - Calculate new attendee_id (different hash due to different recurrence_id)
   - Check User C's homeserver: `/pub/eventky.app/attendees/{attendee_id2}`
   - Verify `partstat`: "DECLINED"
   - Verify `recurrence_id`: "2026-02-03T09:00:00"

10. **Verify Both RSVPs in Nexus**
    - Re-execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_a_id}/{event_id}?limit_attendees=50`
    - Verify attendees array shows User C twice (different recurrence_ids)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Attendee ID is Blake3 hash of event_uri + recurrence_id
- ✅ Attendee stored on User C's homeserver (not User A's)
- ✅ Each instance RSVP creates separate attendee object
- ✅ Event JSON unchanged on User A's homeserver
- ✅ Nexus aggregates attendees from all users' homeservers

### 13.4 Tag Data Flow

#### Test: PUBKY-TAG-001 - Cross-User Event Tagging

**Steps:**

1. **Create Event**
   - Login as User A
   - Create event: "Blockchain Summit"
   - Save and note Event ID
   - Note Event URI: `pubky://{user_a_pk}/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`

2. **User A Tags Own Event**
   - User A adds tag: "blockchain"
   - Save

3. **Calculate Expected Tag ID**
   - Tag ID = Blake3Hash(event_uri + ":" + label)
   - Label: "blockchain"
   - Expected hash format: Base32 encoded Blake3 hash (uppercase)

4. **Verify Tag on User A's Homeserver**
   - Open Pubky Observer with User A's public key
   - Navigate to: `/pub/pubky.app/tags/{tag_id}`
   - Verify JSON file exists

5. **Verify Tag JSON Structure**
   - Check required fields:
     - `uri`: `pubky://{user_a_pk}/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_id}`
     - `label`: "blockchain" (lowercase)
     - `created_at`: Unix microseconds

6. **User B Tags Same Event**
   - Login as User B
   - View User A's event
   - Add tag: "blockchain"
   - Save

7. **Calculate User B's Tag ID**
   - Same formula: Blake3Hash(event_uri + ":" + "blockchain")
   - Same event_uri, same label → same hash
   - Tag ID should match User A's tag ID

8. **Verify Tag on User B's Homeserver**
   - Open Pubky Observer with User B's public key
   - Navigate to: `/pub/pubky.app/tags/{tag_id}`
   - Verify JSON file exists (same tag_id as User A)
   - Verify `uri` points to User A's event

9. **Verify Nexus Event Tags**
   - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_a_id}/{event_id}?limit_tags=10&limit_taggers=10`
   - Check response `tags` array includes "blockchain"
   - Verify tag has multiple taggers (User A and User B)

10. **User B Adds Different Tag**
    - User B adds tag: "web3"
    - Calculate new tag_id (different label)
    - Verify on User B's homeserver: `/pub/pubky.app/tags/{tag_id2}`

11. **Verify Both Tags in Nexus**
    - Re-execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_a_id}/{event_id}?limit_tags=10`
    - Verify tags array shows both "blockchain" and "web3"
    - Check "blockchain" has 2 taggers, "web3" has 1 tagger

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tag ID is Blake3 hash of tagged_uri + ":" + label
- ✅ Same tag by different users creates separate files (same ID, different homeservers)
- ✅ Tags stored at `/pub/pubky.app/tags/` (not `/pub/eventky.app/`)
- ✅ Tag URI points to original event creator's homeserver
- ✅ Nexus aggregates tags from all users

### 13.5 Cross-User Data Visibility

#### Test: PUBKY-INT-001 - Complete Data Flow Integration

**Steps:**

1. **Setup**
   - User A: Calendar owner, Event creator
   - User B: Calendar author, creates event in calendar
   - User C: Tags events, RSVPs to events

2. **User A Creates Calendar**
   - Create calendar: "Public Tech Events"
   - Add User B as author
   - Note Calendar ID and URI

3. **User A Creates Event**
   - Create event: "AI Workshop"
   - Link to calendar
   - Note Event ID and URI

4. **User B Creates Event in Same Calendar**
   - Login as User B
   - Create event: "Hackathon"
   - Link to same calendar
   - Note Event ID and URI

5. **Verify Homeserver Separation**
   - User A's homeserver:
     - Has calendar: `/pub/eventky.app/calendars/{cal_id}`
     - Has User A's event: `/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_a_id}`
     - Does NOT have User B's event
   - User B's homeserver:
     - Does NOT have calendar
     - Has User B's event: `/pub/eventky.app/events/{event_b_id}`
     - Event references User A's calendar URI

6. **User C RSVPs to Both Events**
   - RSVP "ACCEPTED" to User A's event
   - RSVP "TENTATIVE" to User B's event

7. **Verify User C's Homeserver**
   - Check User C's homeserver:
     - Has attendee for User A's event: `/pub/eventky.app/attendees/{hash_a}`
     - Has attendee for User B's event: `/pub/eventky.app/attendees/{hash_b}`
     - Does NOT have events or calendar

8. **User C Tags Both Events**
   - Tag User A's event: "ai"
   - Tag User B's event: "coding"

9. **Verify User C's Tags**
   - Check User C's homeserver:
     - Has tag: `/pub/pubky.app/tags/{tag_id_ai}` (points to User A's event URI)
     - Has tag: `/pub/pubky.app/tags/{tag_id_coding}` (points to User B's event URI)

10. **Verify Nexus Aggregation**
    - Execute: `GET /v0/calendar/{user_a_id}/{calendar_id}`
    - Verify calendar includes both events (from User A and User B)
    - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_a_id}/{event_a_id}?limit_tags=10&limit_attendees=10`
    - Verify event shows User C's RSVP and tag
    - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_b_id}/{event_b_id}?limit_tags=10&limit_attendees=10`
    - Verify event shows User C's RSVP and tag

11. **Remove User B as Calendar Author**
    - Login as User A
    - Edit calendar, remove User B from authors
    - Save

12. **Verify Calendar Re-indexing**
    - Wait 2-3 seconds
    - Execute: `GET /v0/calendar/{user_a_id}/{calendar_id}`
    - Verify calendar events array NO LONGER includes User B's event
    - Execute: `GET /v0/event/{user_b_id}/{event_b_id}` (direct event access)
    - Verify User B's event still accessible (not deleted)
    - Verify event's `x_pubky_calendar_uris` still references calendar

13. **Verify Data Persistence**
    - User B's event still exists on User B's homeserver
    - User C's RSVP still exists on User C's homeserver
    - User C's tag still exists on User C's homeserver
    - Only Nexus index changed (de-indexed from calendar view)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Each user stores only their own data on their homeserver
- ✅ Events reference calendars via URIs (no data duplication)
- ✅ RSVPs and tags stored on tagger's homeserver, reference target URIs
- ✅ Nexus aggregates data from multiple homeservers
- ✅ Removing author de-indexes events from calendar but doesn't delete data
- ✅ Direct event access still works after de-indexing

**Test Results:**

## Priority Guidelines

- **High Priority:** Core functionality, data integrity, security, user-blocking issues
- **Medium Priority:** Important features, UX issues, edge cases
- **Low Priority:** Nice-to-have features, minor UI issues, rare edge cases

---

## Notes for Testers

1. **Nexus Indexing:** Most writes have 2-3 second delay before appearing in Nexus. Wait and refresh if data seems missing.

2. **Optimistic Updates:** UI shows changes immediately (optimistic updates) but data might rollback if write fails. Verify persistence.

3. **Cache Behavior:** React Query caches data. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) bypasses cache. Understand difference between cache and source data.

4. **Cross-User Testing:** Many tests require multiple logged-in users. Use different browsers or incognito windows.

5. **Pubky Data Integrity Tests:** Section 13 tests validate the actual Pubky protocol implementation. These tests prove Eventky uses decentralized storage correctly and can be demonstrated during technical presentations or Q&A.
